# pwd-manager

How It Works
Creating a New Account: Upon the first use, the user is prompted to create a master password. This password will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data.
Adding a Password: Users can input the website/service name, username, and password, and the manager will securely save this information.
Searching for a Password: If the user needs to retrieve a password, they can search by website/service name, and the relevant details will be decrypted and displayed.
Encrypting/Decrypting Passwords: Encryption ensures that passwords are securely stored. When the user accesses them, they are decrypted using the master password.

Security Considerations
Encryption: All passwords are encrypted using a secure method (such as AES or bcrypt) before being saved to the storage file.
Master Password: The master password is never stored in plain text. Instead, a hashed version is stored, ensuring that even if the storage file is accessed by an attacker, the master password remains protected.


Future Enhancements
Graphical User Interface (GUI): A user-friendly GUI could be added using Tkinter to provide a more accessible experience.
Password Generator: A Password generator to be implemented to create and store generated passwords
Cloud Synchronization: Integration with cloud services (like Google Drive or Dropbox) to sync passwords across multiple devices.
Two-Factor Authentication: Adding an extra layer of security with two-factor authentication for account access.
Password Strength Checker: Implementing a feature that checks the strength of user-generated passwords and suggests improvements.
